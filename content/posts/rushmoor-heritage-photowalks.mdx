# This Moment in History

2020 has been a year like no other, as none of us alive today will have ever encountered any of the goings-on we’ve been experiencing. So many of us have been locked-down with people like myself “shielding” and seeing very little of the outside world.   
   
This week many of us shielders will be able to go about our lives again albeit with the same measures in place as everyone else. The need to wear masks, keep social distance effecting us all in equal measure.  

however for some people, they never stopped, they were allowed flexibility given the fact they were helping others. Many keyworkers were in fact volunteers and I’m not talking of the NHS folk but a band of lovely people delivering help and assistance to those most in need. 

This project revolves around these great individuals including first responders and others
