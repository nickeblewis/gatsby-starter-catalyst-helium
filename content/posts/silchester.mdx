This post will evolve over time as I am going to pick a few locations that I love and visit them at different times of the year to take the same scene throughout the seasons. In this case I've visited Silchester and picked outa few different spots in the same vicinity. Each time I update the post, I shall change the date and share via my social media channels, as we go along. Follow my blog to learn of other locations I pick for this project across Hampshire, Surrey, Dorest and Berkshire (my stomping ground!).
